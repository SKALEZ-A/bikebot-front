# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the mobile typography optimization for the AboutSection component. The goal is to reduce font sizes specifically on mobile devices to create a more professional appearance while maintaining readability and the existing visual hierarchy.

## Architecture

The solution will leverage Tailwind CSS's responsive design utilities to apply different font sizes based on screen breakpoints. The implementation will be contained within the AboutSection component and will not affect other components or desktop styling.

### Current State Analysis

Based on the current AboutSection implementation:
- Main description text uses `text-figma-body-medium` class
- Mission statement text uses `text-figma-body-medium` class  
- Both text elements currently have the same font size across all devices
- The component already has responsive behavior for layout but not for typography

### Target Breakpoints

- Mobile: `< 768px` (default Tailwind breakpoint)
- Tablet and up: `≥ 768px` (md: breakpoint and above)

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Components

**AboutSection.tsx**
- Main description paragraph (`<p>` element containing BikeBot description)
- Mission statement paragraph (`<p>` element within the bordered quote section)

### Typography Scale

**Mobile Font Sizes (< 768px):**
- Main description: `text-sm` (14px) - reduced from current medium size
- Mission statement: `text-sm` (14px) - reduced from current medium size

**Desktop Font Sizes (≥ 768px):**
- Main description: `md:text-figma-body-medium` - maintains current size
- Mission statement: `md:text-figma-body-medium` - maintains current size

**Line Height Adjustments:**
- Mobile: `leading-relaxed` (1.625) for optimal readability on smaller screens
- Desktop: Maintain existing `leading-relaxed` for consistency

## Data Models

No data model changes are required. This is purely a presentation layer optimization.

## Error Handling

### Responsive Behavior Validation
- Ensure font sizes render correctly across different mobile device sizes
- Verify that text remains readable at the smallest supported screen sizes
- Confirm that the responsive breakpoints work as expected

### Fallback Considerations
- If custom Figma classes are not available, fallback to standard Tailwind typography classes
- Ensure graceful degradation on older browsers that may not support all CSS features

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
1. **Mobile Device Testing**
   - Test on various mobile screen sizes (320px, 375px, 414px widths)
   - Verify font sizes are appropriately reduced
   - Confirm text remains readable and professional-looking

2. **Responsive Breakpoint Testing**
   - Test the transition between mobile and desktop breakpoints
   - Ensure no layout shifts or typography jumps occur
   - Verify smooth scaling across different screen sizes

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test on major mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)
   - Verify consistent rendering across different devices
   - Check for any browser-specific typography rendering issues

### Accessibility Testing
1. **Readability Validation**
   - Ensure text meets WCAG contrast requirements
   - Verify font sizes are not too small for accessibility standards
   - Test with screen readers to ensure content remains accessible

2. **User Experience Testing**
   - Validate that reduced font sizes improve the professional appearance
   - Confirm that text hierarchy remains clear and logical
   - Ensure content is still scannable and easy to read

### Implementation Validation
1. **Code Quality**
   - Verify Tailwind classes are applied correctly
   - Ensure responsive utilities follow best practices
   - Confirm no conflicts with existing styles

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Verify no additional CSS bundle size increase
   - Ensure responsive behavior doesn't impact rendering performance

## Implementation Notes

### Tailwind CSS Classes to Use
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
text-sm leading-relaxed md:text-figma-body-medium md:leading-relaxed
```

### Specific Elements to Modify
1. **Main Description Paragraph**: The paragraph containing the BikeBot description text
2. **Mission Statement Paragraph**: The italic text within the orange-bordered quote section

### Responsive Design Pattern
The implementation will follow Tailwind's mobile-first responsive design pattern:
- Base styles apply to mobile devices
- `md:` prefix applies styles for medium screens and up (≥ 768px)

This ensures optimal performance and follows modern responsive design best practices.
