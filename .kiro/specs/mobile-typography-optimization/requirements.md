# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the typography in the AboutSection component specifically for mobile devices to achieve a more professional appearance. The current mobile font sizes are too large and need to be reduced to improve readability and visual hierarchy on smaller screens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user visiting the BikeBot website, I want the descriptive text to be appropriately sized for mobile screens, so that the content appears professional and is easy to read without overwhelming the viewport.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the AboutSection on mobile devices (screen width < 768px) THEN the main description paragraph SHALL use a smaller font size than the current implementation
2. WHEN a user views the AboutSection on mobile devices THEN the mission statement text SHALL use a smaller font size than the current implementation
3. WHEN a user views the AboutSection on desktop devices THEN the font sizes SHALL remain unchanged to maintain the existing design
4. WHEN the font sizes are reduced on mobile THEN the line height SHALL be adjusted proportionally to maintain optimal readability
5. WHEN the typography changes are applied THEN the overall visual hierarchy SHALL be preserved with appropriate spacing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the BikeBot website, I want the mobile typography optimization to be implemented using responsive design principles, so that the changes are maintainable and consistent with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the mobile typography optimization THEN the solution SHALL use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) for consistency
2. WHEN the mobile font sizes are defined THEN they SHALL follow a logical scale that maintains readability across different mobile device sizes
3. WHEN the changes are implemented THEN the existing desktop styling SHALL not be affected
4. WHEN the component is updated THEN the responsive behavior SHALL work seamlessly across all breakpoints
5. WHEN the typography is optimized THEN the text SHALL remain accessible and meet WCAG guidelines for contrast and readability
