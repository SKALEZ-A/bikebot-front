3. **Line Height Testing**: Automated measurement of spacing ratios

#### Manual Testing
1. **Screen Reader Testing**: Tested with browser screen reader extensions
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and focus management verification
3. **Zoom Testing**: Browser zoom functionality up to 200%
4. **Device Testing**: Responsive behavior across multiple screen sizes

#### Interactive Testing Environment
